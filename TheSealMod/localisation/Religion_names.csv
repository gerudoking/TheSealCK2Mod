giantcult_DESC;Among the many titanic religions, the Giant's Cult is focused on the primal aspect of the doctrine. It's origin is dated from the First Age, emerging from shamanic cults of old. Somewhere around the Second Age, the religion became organized under a loosely centralized clergy, becoming a major religion in Nanoon. However, after the rise of Casimir as emperor, the Giant's Cult had trouble conciliating the godhood of the new emperor and their religion.
